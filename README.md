# Tugas Besar 2 - Inteligensi Buatan (IF3170)

## Project Description
This project aims to apply machine learning algorithms on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, a network traffic dataset that includes various types of cyber-attacks and normal activities. The goal is to classify the `attack_cat` (attack category) based on network features. 

The machine learning algorithms to be implemented include:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from scratch
- Gaussian Naive-Bayes from scratch
- ID3 from scratch

Additionally, implementations using scikit-learn will be compared with the scratch implementations. The project involves the following key steps:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Transformation (e.g., encoding, normalization)
3. Feature Selection
4. Dimensionality Reduction
5. Model Training, Validation, and Evaluation

## Setting Up the Virtual Environment (venv)
