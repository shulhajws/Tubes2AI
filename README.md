## Setting Up the Virtual Environment (venv)

Follow these steps to set up the virtual environment and install the required dependencies for this project.

### 1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd your-repository
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

Windows:
```
python -m venv venv
```

macOS/Linux:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
This will create a venv directory in your project folder.

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.

Windows:
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
macOS/Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Once activated, your terminal prompt should change to show the (venv) prefix, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

### 4. Install Required Dependencies
Now, you need to install the project dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

Run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the required Python packages into the virtual environment.

### 5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment (Optional)
When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:
```
deactivate
```

Running the Project
Describe how to run your project, e.g., starting the server, running Jupyter notebooks, etc.

Example for a Jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook IF3170\ Artificial\ Intelligence\ _\ Tugas\ Besar\ 2\ Notebook\ Template.ipynb
```
